# React 19 Learning Showcase üöÄ

A practical learning project built with **React 19**, demonstrating core frontend engineering concepts including **data fetching**, **configurable components**, **context management**, **reducer functions**, **form validation**, and **custom hooks**.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of modern React 19 capabilities and architectural patterns.  
It integrates real-world use cases such as API data fetching, state management with context + reducers, reusable form handling, and component configuration via props and custom hooks.

## üß© Key Learning Areas

### 1. Fetching Data from a Backend
- Implemented `fetch()` and `axios` for RESTful API communication.  
- Used **async/await** for clean asynchronous logic.  
- Implemented **loading**, **error**, and **success** states.  
- Demonstrated dynamic rendering of fetched data.

### 2. Creation of Configurable Components
- Built reusable UI components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, `InputField`) with props for customization.  
- Introduced **default props** and **prop validation** using TypeScript or PropTypes.  
- Showcased component composition and controlled inputs.

### 3. Context and Reducer Functions
- Utilized the **Context API** for global state management.  
- Combined **useReducer** with Context for predictable state updates.  
- Ensured separation of concerns by abstracting reducer logic into dedicated files.

### 4. Form Submission and Validation
- Created dynamic forms using **controlled components**.  
- Integrated validation using **custom logic** and third-party libraries like `Yup` or `react-hook-form`.  
- Handled submission with proper error and success feedback.

### 5. Custom Hooks
- Developed custom hooks (e.g., `useFetch`, `useForm`, `useToggle`) for reusability and cleaner logic separation.  
- Showcased how custom hooks encapsulate stateful logic and improve code maintainability.
